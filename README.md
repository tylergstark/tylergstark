Hi, I'm Tyler Stark!
I'm a data scientist with a passion for problem-solving and translating complex data into actionable insights. Currently, I'm pursuing my M.S. in Data Science at Eastern University, where Iâ€™m refining my skills in Python, R, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization. Alongside my studies, I work as a Graduate Assistant, teaching and supporting students in the field of data science.

I have a strong background in database management, statistical analysis, and machine learning, with experience working on diverse projects like predicting student performance, analyzing health trends, and developing financial models. My previous roles in finance, wellness, and music performance have also honed my leadership, communication, and project management skills, allowing me to collaborate effectively and deliver high-quality results.

Iâ€™m excited about using data science to solve real-world problems and help organizations make data-driven decisions. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing data science, projects, or potential collaborations!
